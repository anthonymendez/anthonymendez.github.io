Project Boost is a 3D Unity game where the player must navigate the in game caves and land on the green pads to move on to the next level. Game created following along with <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse2/">Complete C# Unity Developer 3D</a> on Udemy.

### Development

I enrolled in a Udemy Course called the <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse2/">Complete C# Unity Developer 3D</a>. I enrolled in this course because I wanted to get back into the habit of working on Unity on the side during my internship. 

Developing this game wasn't too difficult as most of it was just following the course in how they tackled beginner topics in Unity such as taking input from the keyboard, how to translate and rotate the rocket ship, etc.

What I'm more impressed with is the exact use for 2 Scripts for this game. Compared to my game Vector Shot where I used more than 10+ scripts. One of the first things I learned is that just because I can use more scripts, doesn't mean I should.
