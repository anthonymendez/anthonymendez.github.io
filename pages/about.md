Hi, I'm Anthony. I'm a student attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I'm going for a Bachelors of Science in Computer Systems Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science. I'm currently the Vice-Chair of the <a href = "http://sites.ieee.org/sb-umassa/">IEEE UMass Student Chapter</a> where we create and volunteer events for the undergraduates of the ECE department.
