Lack of a motivation is a big issue for me. A week of free time, a weekend of free time, or no free time at all. Motivation is something I struggled with, and it shows with some of my projects.

My most recent endeavor has been Cart Duty. Cart Duty is supposed to be an arcade FPS game where you're a Cart Boy, who must return carts in a short period of time. My friend Mauro and I had these grandiose ideas such as: 
* Adding combo multiplier that increases with carts returned in a short period of time
* Throwing the cart with the speed depending on how long you hold down the throw button
