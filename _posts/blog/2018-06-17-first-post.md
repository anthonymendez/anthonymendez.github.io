### Hi! Welcome to my new personal website! 

I've been working on and off on a portfolio-type website for a bit of time now. Never actually finished it. Like here was a prototype I was working on for some time...

*My attempt at building a site from scratch... <strong>yeesh</strong>*

I went back and forth on using a framework, to building it from scratch, etc. I decided to just use Jekyll with the ~~Type-On-Strap~~ (now) HyG template since:
<ul>
<li>It looks great!</li>
<li>Less work for me!</li>
</ul>

### So what is this all about?

Well anything I've been working on, whether it be in school or a side project. Maybe what I'm doing at work but I'll only in a very vague sense.

While it is all hosted on Github Pages!

My main goal is just to be consistent with how often I'm posting. I originally had target of once a weekend, but that can be excessive, so I'll be keeping it a minimum of twice a month.

My *dream* goal would be keep this blog running for a long-time like <a href = "https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a>. It'll be hard, but hey, that's why it's a *dream* goal.
