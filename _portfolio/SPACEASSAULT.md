Space Assault is an 3D on-rails, space-shooter prototype whereby the player must go through the level without dying and destroy as many spaceships as possible. Game created following along with <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse2/">Complete C# Unity Developer 3D</a> on Udemy.

### Development

Following the <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse2/">Complete C# Unity Developer 3D on Udemy</a>, the next project was Space Assault.

Space Assault was a really interesting game to work on as a part of the course because I was learning how to use different elements of the Unity Engine. The Terrain Builder, the Animator, Post Processing Stack. I'm more impressed by the Post Processing Stack that Unity has created and let all developers use for free.

I have experience with working with Terrain Builders before, I used to make some Command and Conquer General Zero Hour maps for myself to play on. Sometimes I just wanted to play games against the AI and be able to capture the command centers of every general possible in one game.

The most difficulty I had with this development process was with the animator. Using the animator was very finicky, sometimes I felt like the Spaceship would just speed up and slow down between areas for no reason, even though I felt like the timing was consistent.
