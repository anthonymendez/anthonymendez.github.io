Vector Shot is a top-down, 2D space shooter built in Unity. Inspired by Hotline Miami, Vector Shot is a short, fast-paced game that requires patience to learn the map. Vector Shot was made for in a week for a game jam.

### Game Objective

The main objective of this game is to collect all 8 keys in the level. Move with WASD, aim with the mouse, shoot with the mouse and you reload with R.

### Development

When I first started working with Unity, I was just playing around with the engine, prototyping something for a few hours before on to something else. While I enjoyed this for sometime, I never really got around to actually to making a game. So I decided to try out a Game Jam to motivate myself into actually finishing a game.

So I signed up for the _Summer of Fast-To- Complete Games_ jam. The objective was simple, make a game that can be completed in one minute. I had a week to make it. The period of time was perfect because I had ample time to learn implement the main features I wanted, but also still had to finish prototyping it at some point.

The art assets I made were meant to be place holders. But about halfway into creating the art I decided to stick with it because it would fit, not only the name of the game, but also the art style I intended pretty well.

The music was something I had found on Reddit during the week. It was created by <a href = "https://bradpodraymusic.com/home">Brad Podray</a> and he was kind enough to let me use it in my game. He makes great soundtracks intended to be used in video games so he's worth checking out if you're working on your own project and need some cool music.

### Final Words

Looking back on Vector Shot, I am incredibly happy with the way it turned out. It's the first game I _finished_. Something I still try to pursue while prototyping anything. If there's one thing I would have to change, it would be the documentation. I took a crack at going back and refactoring the code to make it more readable, but I stopped after a bit once I realized I didn't have the motivation for this project in particular.

I think leaving the code as is, is a nice reminder for myself of when I started.
