Corgi Course is 2D Side-Scrolling Infinite Runner game made in Unity. The game is a barebones game with a basic goal: Jump over all the vacuum cleaners. Corgi Course was made in a week with two friends for a Game Jam.

### Development

I enrolled in the <a href = "https://itch.io/jam/dog-jam">Dog Jam</a> because I need another Game Jam to motivate me to create and finish a basic game. For this game jam, I would create an infinite side-scroller with the viewport designed for mobile devices.

I partnered up with my friends <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-norton-b65250131/">Christian Norton</a> and Stephan Kim. Christian would provide the art assets and Stephan provided the music track. I would be in charge of programming and designing all the game mechanics, UI, and player experience.

For the scrolling background, instead of moving the Corgi, I would just move everything but the Corgi. As the objects disappeared off-screen, they would spawn back on the off-screen to the right with a randomly chosen skin. So while it looks like the player is moving towards the right, they are actually just standing still or jumping in place. The environment is moving to the left and respawning itself off-screen to the right.

### Final Words

Corgi Course was a fun little project. I’m glad I was able to get Christian and Stephan’s help because that allowed me more time to focus on actually programming the game.

If there was one thing I would do differently, it would be how fast I would be coding the project. With some more Unity experience under my belt now, I feel like I could do this project in a weekend rather than a week.
